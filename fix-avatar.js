// Quick Fix for Avatar Initial
// Run this in your browser console (F12) to update localStorage with your name

// For Student (if you're logged in as student "aditya"):
localStorage.setItem('name', 'aditya');
localStorage.setItem('fullName', 'aditya');

console.log('✅ Name updated in localStorage!');
console.log('Now refresh the page to see your avatar change from "S" to "A"');

// Alternative: Just reload the page after running this
// window.location.reload();
